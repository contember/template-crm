## Concepts

- **Forms**: Customizable form components for creating and editing entities, extracted from edit and create pages.
- **Previews**: Defines how the Entity is represented in the UI, often combining fields like name, title, creation time, etc.
- **Details**: Read-only, formatted fields for better readability, extracted from detail pages.

## Key Features

- **Authentication System**: Secure login and password reset functionality
- **Headless UI Components**: Flexible, reusable components in the `lib` directory
- **Modern Styling**: Built with TailwindCSS and [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com) for beautiful, responsive designs
- **Modular Architecture**: Well-organized codebase for easy maintenance and scaling
- **Type-Safe Development**: Fully typed with TypeScript for better development experience
